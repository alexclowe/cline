# Cline-Flow Integration - Phase 2.2.2, 2.2.3, 2.2.4 Implementation Prompt

## PROJECT CONTEXT

I am continuing the Cline-Flow integration project, implementing Claude-Flow's advanced multi-agent coordination capabilities into Cline's VSCode extension. **Phase 2.2.1 (Core Infrastructure) is 100% COMPLETE** and the orchestration bridge is production-ready.

## CURRENT STATUS

### âœ… COMPLETED (Phase 2.2.1)
- **Controller Integration**: Orchestration components fully integrated into `src/core/controller/index.ts`
- **Task Complexity Assessment**: `shouldUseOrchestration()` method with intelligent routing (complexity threshold: 0.4)
- **VSCode Settings Integration**: Complete user control via `package.json` configuration
- **Orchestrated Task Execution**: `attemptOrchestration()` with adaptive mode and graceful fallback
- **Real-time Metrics**: `getOrchestrationStatus()` with health monitoring
- **Testing**: All orchestration logic tests passing (100% success rate)

### ðŸŽ¯ NEXT PHASES TO IMPLEMENT

## Phase 2.2.2 - Specialized Agents Implementation

### OBJECTIVE
Complete the AgentFactory implementation with specialized agent types for different task domains.

### TASKS
1. **Complete AgentFactory Specialized Agents** (`src/orchestration/AgentFactory.ts`):
   - **CoderAgent**: Code generation, file manipulation, debugging
   - **PlannerAgent**: Task analysis, strategy planning, workflow design
   - **ReviewerAgent**: Code review, quality assessment, testing
   - **ResearcherAgent**: Information gathering, documentation, analysis

2. **Agent Capabilities Implementation**:
   - Each agent should have specialized prompts for their domain
   - Domain-specific tool access and permissions
   - Role-based coordination protocols
   - Performance metrics tracking per agent type

3. **VS Code LM API Integration**:
   - All agents must use VS Code Language Model API exclusively
   - Proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
   - Resource management and cleanup

## Phase 2.2.3 - Advanced Coordination Strategies

### OBJECTIVE
Complete coordination strategy implementations for different orchestration patterns.

### TASKS
1. **Complete CoordinationStrategy Implementations** (`src/orchestration/CoordinationStrategy.ts`):
   - **SequentialStrategy**: Tasks executed in order, each builds on previous
   - **ParallelStrategy**: Independent tasks executed simultaneously
   - **PipelineStrategy**: Output of one agent feeds input of next
   - **HierarchicalStrategy**: Master-worker pattern with delegation
   - **SwarmStrategy**: Distributed coordination with consensus

2. **Strategy Selection Logic**:
   - Automatic strategy selection based on task characteristics
   - Manual strategy override via configuration
   - Dynamic strategy switching during execution
   - Performance optimization per strategy type

3. **Resource Management**:
   - Agent allocation and load balancing
   - Memory and processing limits
   - Timeout handling and recovery

## Phase 2.2.4 - Optimization & End-to-End Testing

### OBJECTIVE
Complete system optimization and comprehensive testing for production deployment.

### TASKS
1. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Agent resource usage optimization
   - Memory management improvements
   - Execution time optimization
   - Caching and persistence improvements

2. **Comprehensive Testing**:
   - End-to-end orchestration scenarios
   - Multi-agent coordination testing
   - Error handling and recovery testing
   - Performance benchmarking

3. **User Experience Enhancements**:
   - Progress reporting and visualization
   - Agent activity monitoring
   - User feedback and control mechanisms
   - Documentation and help system

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS (MUST MAINTAIN)

- **VS Code LM API Exclusive**: No individual API keys, must use VS Code Language Model API
- **Non-Invasive Integration**: Optional enhancement layer, never modify core Cline functionality
- **Graceful Fallback**: Always degrade to standard Cline behavior when orchestration fails
- **Production Ready**: Robust error handling, resource cleanup, user control

## TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

Current integration pattern (DO NOT MODIFY):
```
WebviewProvider -> Controller -> Task (Standard Cline Flow)
                      â†“
               OrchestrationBridge (Optional Enhancement)
                      â†“
           ClaudeFlowOrchestrator -> SwarmCoordinator -> Agents
```

## KEY FILES TO WORK WITH

### Phase 2.2.2 (Agents):
- `src/orchestration/AgentFactory.ts` - Complete specialized agent implementations
- `src/orchestration/ClaudeFlowOrchestrator.ts` - Update to use specialized agents
- `src/orchestration/TaskAnalyzer.ts` - Enhance task-to-agent mapping

### Phase 2.2.3 (Coordination):
- `src/orchestration/CoordinationStrategy.ts` - Complete all strategy implementations
- `src/swarm/coordinator.ts` - Enhance coordination capabilities
- `src/orchestration/ClaudeFlowOrchestrator.ts` - Integrate advanced strategies

### Phase 2.2.4 (Testing & Optimization):
- Create comprehensive test suites
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- User experience improvements

## REFERENCE DOCUMENTATION

- **Phase 2.2.1 Completion**: See `Phase-2-2-1-COMPLETED.md` for full technical details
- **Architecture Guide**: See `.clinerules/cline-overview.md` for Cline extension patterns
- **Integration Strategy**: See `cline-flow-integration-strategy.md` for project overview

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

### Phase 2.2.2 Complete When:
- [ ] All 4 specialized agent types implemented and functional
- [ ] Agent-specific capabilities and tool access working
- [ ] VS Code LM API integration for all agents verified
- [ ] Agent performance metrics tracking operational

### Phase 2.2.3 Complete When:
- [ ] All 5 coordination strategies implemented
- [ ] Automatic strategy selection working
- [ ] Resource management and load balancing functional
- [ ] Dynamic strategy switching operational

### Phase 2.2.4 Complete When:
- [ ] End-to-end orchestration scenarios tested
- [ ] Performance optimization complete
- [ ] User experience enhancements implemented
- [ ] Production deployment ready

## IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY

1. **Start with Phase 2.2.2**: Focus on AgentFactory specialized agents first
2. **Then Phase 2.2.3**: Implement coordination strategies
3. **Finally Phase 2.2.4**: Optimize and test comprehensively

Each phase builds on the previous, so complete them in order. The foundation from Phase 2.2.1 is solid and production-ready.

---

**NOTE**: This is a continuation of a successfully completed phase. The orchestration infrastructure is fully functional and ready for enhancement. Focus on building upon the existing foundation rather than reimplementing core functionality.
